/*:
 
 //First, the path property needs to have the type NavigationPath rather than [Int]:
 var path: NavigationPath {
     didSet {
         save()
     }
 }
 
 //Second, when we decode our JSON in the initializer we need to decode to a specific type, then use the decoded data to create a new NavigationPath:

 if let decoded = try? JSONDecoder().decode(NavigationPath.CodableRepresentation.self, from: data) {
     path = NavigationPath(decoded)
     return
 }
 
 //Third, if decoding fails we should assign a new, empty NavigationPath instance to the path property at the end of the initializer:
 
 path = NavigationPath()
 
 //And finally, the save() method needs to write the Codable representation of our navigation path. This is where things diverge just a little more from using a simple array, because NavigationPath doesn't require that its data types conform to Codable â€“ it only needs Hashable conformance. As a result, Swift can't verify at compile time that there is a valid Codable representation of the navigation path, so we need to request it and see what comes back.
 
 //That means adding a check at the start of the save() method, which attempts to retrieve the Codable navigation path and bails out immediately if we get nothing back:

 guard let representation = path.codable else { return }
 
 //That will either return the data ready to be encoded to JSON, or return nil if at least one object in the path cannot be encoded.

 //Finally, we convert that Codable representation to JSON instead of the original Int array:

 let data = try JSONEncoder().encode(representation)
