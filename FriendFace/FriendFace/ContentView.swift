 []Your first step should be to examine the JSON. The URL you want to use is this: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/samples/friendface.json
 []As you can see, there is an array of people, and each person has an ID, name, age, email address, and more. They also have an array of tag strings, and an array of friends, where each friend has a name and ID.
 []Fetch the data and parse it into User and Friend structs.
 []Display a list of users with a little information about them, such as their name and whether they are active right now.
 [] Create a detail view shown when a user is tapped, presenting more information about them, including the names of their friends.
 []Before you start your download, check that your User array is empty so that you donâ€™t keep starting the download every time the view is shown.
 try? modelContext.delete(model: Person.self)
 
 []start by designing your types: build a User struct with properties for name, age, company, and so on,
 [] then a Friend struct with id and name.
 [] dsed3After that, move onto some URLSession code to fetch the data and decode it into your types.

         The completion handler, a closure, is executed when the data task completes, successfully or unsuccessfully. The completion handler accepts three arguments, an optional Data object, an optional URLResponse object, and an optional Error object.
         
         A data task fails or succeeds.
         If the data task fails, then error has a value.
         If the data task succeeds, then data and response have a value. We are not interested in the URLResponse object for now.
         We safely unwrap the Data object and use it to create a Person instance. I
