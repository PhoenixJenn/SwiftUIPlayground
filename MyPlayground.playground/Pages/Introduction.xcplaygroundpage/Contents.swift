 If we had an image in our page's resource folder, we could display it here:
 
 ![Caption if Image is Not Found](missingimage.png)
 
 
 Here is a video (but not really)
 
 ![Caption if Video is Not Found](missing_video.mp4 poster="thumbnail.png" width="640" height="300")
 

>  You can create a code snippet by highlighting a block of code, going to Editor, Create Code Snippet
